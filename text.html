        FizCoin is designed for decentralized olympiads.
    </h1>
    <pre>
        A large number of students solve problems in physics, astronomy and astrophysics.
        There are many olympiads, and not every one gives advantages for admission to universities,
        institutes, monetary or material remuneration. But the award for the winners is primarily
        an incentive to solve future problems at the next olympiads.
  	</pre>
    <h2>
        FizCoin Foundation
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Fund helps token holders to solve problems in physics and astronomy. Anyone can
        solve the problem, send it to the blockchain and get rewarded for the
        correct answer. Therefore, solving problems turns the olympiad into an interesting
        journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of the FizCoin Foundation is to increase the level of knowledge in the
        field of physics and astronomy among students around the world. Checking the answers
        to tasks will be honest and decentralized, and voting in the FizCoin DAO will be an
        incentive to generate interesting and unusual tasks. Solving the tasks themselves will
        become an unusual hobby for buying souvenirs and NFT for FIZ tokens.
    </p>
    <h2>FIZ Token</h2>
    <p>
        The FizCoin token allows the community to own the protocol and actively manage it: create
        physics and astronomy problems, receive rewards for the correct answer to the problem and
        vote for interesting and unusual tasks. FIZ owners manage the protocol through a management
        process on the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        The FIZ token is a solvent coin that can be bought or sold on decentralized exchanges (DEX),
        for example on Uniswap (see the Buy/Sell section). For the FIZ token, you can buy souvenirs,
        NFT and much more in the Polygon blockchain. Also, FIZ can be exchanged for fiat (USDT, USDC,
        DAI) or for an ETH coin of the Ethereum blockchain, and already transferred to the Ethereum
        blockchain. For example, take the marketplace
        <a class="text-link" href="https://rarible.com/explore/polygon">Rarible</a>, where you can
        buy NFT for ETH or MATIC (now Polygon).
    </p>
    <h2>
        FizCoin DAO
    </h2>
    <p>
        FizCoin DAO — a decentralized autonomous organization in which votes are held, according
        to the results of which the most interesting and unusual tasks are published.
    </p>
	<p>
        Participants of different statuses and different privileges participate in the DAO.
	</p>
    <h2>
        FizCoin protocol
    </h2>
    <p>
        FIZ is an ERC-20 token used in the FizCoin ecosystem to receive a reward for the correct
        answer to a problem in physics, astrophysics. The FizCoin protocol is an open source ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since FizCoin is a decentralized ecosystem, it serves several purposes:

        How does FizCoin work?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The FizCoin smart contract protocol runs on a decentralized blockchain
        <a class="text-link" href="https://polygon.technology /">Polygon</a>, which means everyone
        can join the project and start solving problems.

        Solving and sending problems
	</h2>
	<p>
        Each participant of the FizCoin ecosystem has the opportunity to solve problems and send answers
        to the pool. Each task has its own deadline. After the deadline, the system does not accept responses.
        It expects a private key within two days to decrypt and verify the responses. After the reconciliation,
        the calculation of the accrual of remuneration and the accrual itself takes place, if the participant's
        response is correct.
	</p>
	<p>
        Before sending a response to the system, the participant freezes the contribution amount in the form of
        a FIZ token. The participant has the right to change and resend the response before the deadline. After
        the deadline and receipt by the system of the decryption key of the answers, the participant requests
        verification and receipt of a reward in the form of a FIZ token.
