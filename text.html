        FizCoin is designed for decentralized olympiads.
    </h1>
    <pre>
        A large number of students solve problems in physics, astronomy and astrophysics.
        There are many olympiads, and not every one gives advantages for admission to universities,
        institutes, monetary or material remuneration. But the award for the winners is primarily
        an incentive to solve future problems at the next olympiads.
  	</pre>
    <h2>
        FizCoin Foundation
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Fund helps token holders to solve problems in physics and astronomy. Anyone can
        solve the problem, send it to the blockchain and get rewarded for the
        correct answer. Therefore, solving problems turns the olympiad into an interesting
        journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of the FizCoin Foundation is to increase the level of knowledge in the
        field of physics and astronomy among students around the world. Checking the answers
        to tasks will be honest and decentralized, and voting in the FizCoin DAO will be an
        incentive to generate interesting and unusual tasks. Solving the tasks themselves will
        become an unusual hobby for buying souvenirs and NFT for FIZ tokens.
    </p>
    <h2>FIZ Token</h2>
    <p>
        The FizCoin token allows the community to own the protocol and actively manage it: create
        physics and astronomy problems, receive rewards for the correct answer to the problem and
        vote for interesting and unusual tasks. FIZ owners manage the protocol through a management
        process on the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        The FIZ token is a solvent coin that can be bought or sold on decentralized exchanges (DEX),
        for example on Uniswap (see the Buy/Sell section). For the FIZ token, you can buy souvenirs,
        NFT and much more in the Polygon blockchain. Also, FIZ can be exchanged for fiat (USDT, USDC,
        DAI) or for an ETH coin of the Ethereum blockchain, and already transferred to the Ethereum
        blockchain. For example, take the marketplace
        <a class="text-link" href="https://rarible.com/explore/polygon">Rarible</a>, where you can
        buy NFT for ETH or MATIC (now Polygon).
    </p>
    <h2>
        FizCoin DAO
    </h2>
    <p>
        FizCoin DAO — a decentralized autonomous organization in which votes are held, according
        to the results of which the most interesting and unusual tasks are published.
    </p>
	<p>
        Participants of different statuses and different privileges participate in the DAO.
	</p>
    <h2>
        FizCoin protocol
    </h2>
    <p>
        FIZ is an ERC-20 token used in the FizCoin ecosystem to receive a reward for the correct
        answer to a problem in physics, astrophysics. The FizCoin protocol is an open source ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since FizCoin is a decentralized ecosystem, it serves several purposes:

        How does FizCoin work?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The FizCoin smart contract protocol runs on a decentralized blockchain
        <a class="text-link" href="https://polygon.technology /">Polygon</a>, which means everyone
        can join the project and start solving problems.
    </p>
    <!--    <p>-->
    <!--        In FizCoin, each participant has their own status:-->

    <!--    <p>-->
    <!--        and each status has its own privileges and opportunities. A member of the FizCoin-->

    <!--        First he is a bachelor. The participant can only solve problems and send answers-->
    <!--        to the blockchain. To send a response, you need to make a small contribution to the-->

	<h2>
        Solving and sending problems
	</h2>
	<p>
        Each participant of the FizCoin ecosystem has the opportunity to solve problems and send answers
        to the pool. Each task has its own deadline. After the deadline, the system does not accept responses.
        It expects a private key within two days to decrypt and verify the responses. After the reconciliation,
        the calculation of the accrual of remuneration and the accrual itself takes place, if the participant's
        response is correct.
	</p>
	<p>
        Before sending a response to the system, the participant freezes the contribution amount in the form of
        a FIZ token. The participant has the right to change and resend the response before the deadline. After
        the deadline and receipt by the system of the decryption key of the answers, the participant requests
        verification and receipt of a reward in the form of a FIZ token.

    <h1>#01 FizCoin DAO Governance</h1>
    <pre>
        The FizCoin community governs itself via the FizCoin DAO, the decentralized governance framework that
        supports the Ecosystem Fund. The DAO follows a proposal process to vote on how the Ecosystem Fund will
        be distributed by the FIZ Foundation to promote a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        This governance guide is an overview of the proposal process. It’s a living document that will evolve
        and improve with the DAO community’s input.
    </pre>
    <h3>Membership</h3>
    <p>
        Participating in idea submission, commentary, proposal submission, and voting is restricted to ApeCoin
        DAO members. Holding FizCoin is the only requirement for membership in the DAO.
    </p>

    <h2>Guiding values</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Boldness:</b> We don’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new.</li>
        <li><b>Equality:</b> One FIZ equals one FIZ.</li>
        <li><b>Transparency:</b> Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community.</li>
        <li><b>Collective Responsibility:</b> We leave everything better than we found it.</li>
        <li><b>Persistence:</b> Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>COMMUNICATION CHANNELS</h2>
    <p>
        The FIZ Foundation website is the DAO hub, providing an interface to educate DAO members on the governance
        process and provide easy access to the channels below in order to streamline the DAO’s operation and
        enhance its utility.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Discourse</b> is the first stop for all proposals. An FIP (Fiz Improvement Proposal) Idea is submitted as
        a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a moderator that it complies with DAO-approved
        guidelines before it appears to the community. FizCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication
        process to post ideas or give feedback to ideas via comments.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Snapshot</b> is used for voting. Proposal drafts that have passed their respective approval processes become
        available for voting on Snapshot. ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to vote.

                    all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between the IAA Labs and you regarding
                    the Site. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other
                    provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except where provided by
                    applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation
                    of law or otherwise, without the IAA Labs’ prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign
                    or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right without such consent will
                    be null. The IAA Labs may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject
                    to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors,
                    and permitted assigns.

                    <b>Waiver of Rights.</b> The IAA Labs’ failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
                    will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
